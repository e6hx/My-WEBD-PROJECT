        <p><b>The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has been groundbreaking, reshaping the way we diagnose,
             treat and monitor patients. This technology is drastically improving healthcare research and outcomes by producing more
              accurate diagnoses and enabling more personalized treatments.<br><br> AI in healthcare’s ability to analyze vast 
              amounts of clinical documentation quickly helps medical professionals identify disease markers and trends that 
              would otherwise be overlooked.<br><br> The potential applications of AI and healthcare are broad and far-reaching, from
               scanning radiological images for early detection to predicting outcomes from electronic health records.
                By leveraging artificial intelligence in hospital settings and clinics, healthcare systems can become smarter, 
            faster, and more efficient in providing care to millions of people worldwide.</b></p><br><br>
